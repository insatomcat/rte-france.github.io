                    We believe that our expertise in the energy transmission sector should be open, accessible, and shared.
                    Open source is not only a way to develop software: it is a philosophy that empowers individuals,
                    fosters collaboration, and drives innovation.
                </p>
                <p class="text-justify">
                    By embracing transparency and collective effort, open source enables us to build better, more secure,
                    and more ethical technology. It breaks down barriers, encourages learning, and ensures that progress
                    benefits everyone, not just a select few.

                <p class="text-justify">
                    We stand for a world where ideas are free to grow, where communities thrive through cooperation, and
                    where technology serves humanity, not corporate interests.

                In the software world, open source has become a dominant strategy. Open source is a software development model
                based on a license that allows free access to the source code, free usage, modifications, and derived works, as
                well as royalty-free redistribution. Eventually, this license enabled an outstandingly efficient governance framework
                for collaborative software development across business organizations. Major software companies realized in the 2000s
                that they could leverage these licenses to organize their software strategies around remarkably efficient collaborations
                by pooling the development effort of software technology components that meet shared needs, hence enabling additive
                innovation and simultaneous gains in costs, time to market, and quality. Due to this efficiency, the model spread in
                the software technology and cloud sector, and then into industrial verticals such as telecommunications and automotive.
                This occurred under the aegis of foundations such as The Linux Foundation, which provide a neutral and proven governance
                framework to organize collaborations, build trust among investing partners, and establish state-of-the-art software
                development practices (cybersecurity, etc.).
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                In early 2018, RTE took the gamble that the model could be transposed to the energy sector and decided to start a
                collaboration with Shuli Goodman at The Linux Foundation. This collaboration led to the creation of Linux Foundation
                Energy (LF Energy) in early 2019. Since then, RTE has played a leading role in the foundation as a Strategic Member.
            </p>
            <p class="text-justify">
                LF Energy is a member-funded non-profit organization whose purpose is to accelerate the energy transition through
                collaboration on open source technologies and standards. LF Energy serves as an independent, neutral steward for
                transparently governed open source technologies and standards that serve as the trustworthy, secure digital
                foundation for grid modernization and modern energy services.
            </p>

            <p class="text-justify">
                For RTE, the expected benefits of this software development model are:
            <ul>
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> An acceleration by reusing what exists and sharing efforts, allowing for faster and cheaper software development,
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Industrial-grade software with improved modularity, interoperability, evolutivity, and shorter release time cycles,
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Cutting-edge technological and business model innovation,
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Access, through collaboration, to wider and more diverse skills and viewpoints,
            <li><i class="ri-check-double-line"></i> Reduced vendor lock-in or customer-specific approaches that impede velocity and cost-efficiency.
            </ul>
            </p>
                Today, RTE is actively involved in several LF Energy projects to build the industrial-grade software solutions that meet the needs of its core business.
